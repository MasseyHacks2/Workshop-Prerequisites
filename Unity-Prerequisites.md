## Preliminaries for Intro to Game Dev w/ Unity Lecture

For attendees to be able to participate in the lecture, they must have Unity 5.3.2.

To download Unity 5.3.2, go to [this link](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download?ref=personal) and download the installer. From there run the executable and follow the instructions for an ordinary setup. The installer requries internet connection to download things, like VS 2015 Community.

The first time you open Unity, you'll be asked to sign into your Unity account. This is free, and if you don't have one already go ahead and make one ~[here](https://accounts.unity3d.com/sign-up). After you've signed in, go to the next page. Select "Personal Edition". Agree to the license, then fill out their quick survey.

## Required Skills

It is recommended that attendees be moderately comfortable with C# and elementary OOP topics (objects, classes, methods). A knowledge of Java is also acceptable due to the similarities between the languages. The code we'll be writing during the workshop is pretty self-explanatory and doesn't require an advanced understanding of the language.
